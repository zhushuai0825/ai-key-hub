# No Slop UI

You are building UI for a human audience. The goal is functional, honest, clean. Not impressive. Not dramatic. **Normal.**

If a design decision feels like the easy AI default — it probably is. Pick the harder, cleaner option.

Read `vendor/no-slop-ui/references/banned-patterns.md` for the full banned list before writing any UI code.
Read `vendor/no-slop-ui/references/colour-palettes.md` when you need to pick colours.

## Activation Boundary

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks for UI design, frontend implementation, visual polish, design review, or when the current task's primary deliverable is a visible interface. Do not activate it for backend-only tasks, copywriting, diagrams, infrastructure, or general code review.

Treat this skill as a visual-quality layer. It must not override product requirements, accessibility, security, localization, data correctness, or the repository's existing design system. If those conflict with a no-slop rule, preserve the user requirement and explain the tradeoff.

## The Standard

Think **Linear. Raycast. Stripe. GitHub.** They don't try to grab attention. They just work.

**What normal looks like:**
- Sidebar: 240–260px fixed, solid background, 1px border-right. No floating shells, no rounded outer corners.
- Cards: 8–12px radius max, subtle 1px border, shadow max `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`. No glow, no float.
- Buttons: solid fill or simple border, 6–10px radius max. No pills, no gradients.
- Typography: clear hierarchy, 14–16px body, system font or single sans-serif. No mixed serif/sans.
- Spacing: 4/8/12/16/24/32px scale. Consistent. No random gaps.
- Borders: 1px solid, subtle colour. No thick decorative borders, no gradient borders.
- Transitions: 100–200ms ease. Opacity or colour only. No bouncy, no transforms.
- Inputs: solid border, simple focus ring. Labels above fields.
- Icons: 16–20px, monochrome or subtle colour, no decorative backgrounds.

## Colour Priority

1. **Use existing project colours first** — read `theme.css` CSS variables and `DESIGN.md`.
2. If no palette exists — pick from `vendor/no-slop-ui/references/colour-palettes.md`.
3. Never invent random colour combinations.

## Stack-Specific Notes

**Plain HTML dashboards (this project):**
- Single-file is fine — keep it self-contained
- Use CSS custom properties from `theme.css`
- No external CDN dependencies unless absolutely necessary

## Hard Rules

- No floating glassmorphism panels
- No gradient backgrounds as decoration
- No oversized rounded corners (20px+ everywhere)
- No eyebrow labels (` SECTION LABEL ` above headings)
- No hero sections inside internal dashboards
- No decorative copy ("Operational clarity without the clutter")
- No metric-card grid as the default dashboard layout
- No fake charts that exist to fill space
- No transform animations on hover
- No `Segoe UI`, `Trebuchet MS`, `Arial` font stacks
- No status dots via `::before` pseudo-elements
- No nav badges unless they carry real data
- No pill buttons everywhere
- No dramatic box shadows (24px+ blur)
- No mixed alignment (some left-aligned, some floating center)
